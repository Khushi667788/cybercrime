# 🔐 Cyber Crime Analysis using Machine Learning

Cybercrime is a growing threat in today’s digital world. This project aims to analyze and predict cyber crimes using machine learning algorithms based on real-world datasets. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the project attempts to help stakeholders identify patterns, trends, and potential threats effectively.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a classification model to detect or predict types of cyber crimes. The machine learning pipeline involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Key components:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification using Random Forest
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
- Modular Python code structure
